1- more powerful database storage : sqlite is a choice only to work on demonstration use case

2- more error management and log if scraping failed

3- improve or change way to alert when new review are available (rabbitMQ or other messaging solution like kafka)

4- add new endpoint to add features (smartest data consultation, view list of product, delete them, ...)

5- be careful about captcha 

6- implement review update for already existing record in database
